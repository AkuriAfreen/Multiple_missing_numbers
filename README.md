This Python program reads a sequence of integers from the user and identifies which numbers are missing in the range from 1 to the maximum number in the input.

How it works:
Input:
The user enters a list of space-separated integers.
Example: 1 3 4 6 8

Processing:
The program finds the maximum number in the input (in this case, 8).
It then generates a complete range of numbers from 1 to that maximum.
For each number in this range, it checks if it is not present in the original list.
All such missing numbers are collected in a new list.

Output:
The program prints the list of missing numbers.
Example output: Missing numbers: [2, 5, 7]
